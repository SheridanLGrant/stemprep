Materials for 2017 STEMPREP 7th and 8th grade statistics course at the University of Washington

This was a camp for academically talented middle schoolers who are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields
(Black, Hispanic, and Pacific Islanders). These are the materials I used for the 5 week, 4 1-hour classes-a-day 
course.

I may add lecture notes later, but you can probably fill in the blanks yourself. The course organization was:
Week 1: Probability basics
Week 2: Coding (in R) basics
Week 3: Finish coding, begin data analysis and graphing
Week 4: Data analysis
Week 5: Review, final exam, final project

Some of the homework questions are a little tough. For many of the homeworks, I made the hardest couple
questions optional, since only a fraction of the students could even attempt them. You might want to do the
same. In my class, I would anticipate that the average student will be a strong but not stellar AP student
in high school (will get 4s, maybe a couple 5s, on AP tests with diligent work), if that gives you some
idea of the audience.

Teach the coding at your own risk ;)
