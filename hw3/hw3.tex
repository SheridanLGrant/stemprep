Due Date: Wednesday, July 12th
Turn in this homework by emailing me (SLGstats@uw.edu) an R file with these four functions in it. The file should be named [firstname]\_[lastname]\_hw3.R.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Write an R function for the mathematical function $f(x) = 4x^2 + 3x + \sqrt{x} + \sin(x) + 7$.}
	\item{Write a function that takes in a vector and returns the first 5 elements of that vector, or the phrase ``Vector too short!'' if the vector has length less than 5.}
	\item{Write a function that takes in a whole number $n$ and returns the sum of all the positive odd numbers less than or equal to $n$.}
	\item{Write a function that takes in three numbers and returns the ``middle'' number. That is, the function should take in inputs $a$, $b$, and $c$, and return $a$ if $b \le a \le c$ or $c \le a \le b$, etc.}
\end{enumerate}
